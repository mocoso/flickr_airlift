h1. Flickr Airlift

Flickr Airlift is a command line tool to scrape *any set* _or_ *all photos in the photostream* of a user.
It comes with the bin flickr_airlift.

h1. Stored Authentication.

Once flickr_airlift authenticates you - it stores your authentication in ~/.flick_airliftrc

The @flickr_uplift@ gem was removed from this gem.
It used to upload files from an arbitrary directory.
Muddling together these two features in one gem was a weird idea to begin with.
One day I'll create a separate flickr_uplift gem.
The last version with this functionality is "0.4.3":https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/flickr_airlift/tree/0.4.3
